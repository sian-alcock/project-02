# **Project 1: Superheroes**

## Overview
Superheroes is a fun web-site about superheroes. It consumes an api [acknowledge API]

This project was built as a learning module in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Course using JavaScript and React.

It was programmed jointly by Michael G. Laird and Sian Alcock.

### Project duration
48 hours.

Launch on [GitHub Pages](link).

## Brief

* **Consume a public API** – this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* **Have several components** - At least one classical and one functional.
* **The app should include a router** - with several "pages".
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* Have **semantically clean HTML** - you make sure you write HTML that makes structural sense rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5 with HTML5 audio
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6)
* React
* Bulma
* Lodash
* HashRouter, Route, Switch, Link  from 'react-router-dom'
* Select from 'react-select'
* axios
* ScSS
* Git
* GitHub
* Google Fonts


### Approach Taken

* A **working application**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
* **A `readme.md` file** with:
  * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * A couple of paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    * Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
   * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome

### Game
The game is based on Top Trumps.  The premise is that each player is dealt a card containing a superhero character listing his or her (or it's) power statistics (eg intelligence, power etc.)  The player picks a statistic to compare on by clicking a button and the player with the highest rating for the

### End of game and reset
When either the player or the computer have destroyed all the crops, the game is over.  A 'Start again' button is available to reset the grids, scores etc.

## Wins and Blockers

### Final deliverable looks good and works well

I'm happy with the final deliverable which met the brief. In a relatively short time, I have produced a game that - I believe - looks fun and is easy to navigate and play.

## Future Content

Given more time, we would like to include the following capabilities:
* Consume a second api to include superhero theme tunes
* Keep score between games
* Make more of the groups - eg own entry page
* Superhero name generator

## What we learned

This project was such a great learning experience.  Major learning points:
* Storing on state in React
